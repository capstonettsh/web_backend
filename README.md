# doctor config

This is a work-in-progress! The purpose of this branch is to work on the backend logic of the pages in which the doctor could upload and edit mock patient scenarios.

Added some files for allowing doctor to create scenarios and rubrics.

Not done yet:
- There is no connection to SQL database; right now is local data structure standing in for SQL
- The configId for different scenarios are randomly generated.
- The guidelines and sample responses for the voice AI to follow is not connected to the voice AI agent yet.
